//! Additional array operations for dimtensor.
//!
//! This module contains operations that may be added in future versions,
//! such as ufuncs (sin, cos, sqrt, etc.) and more complex array operations.

// Placeholder for future operations:
// - Scalar-array operations
// - Broadcasting support
// - ufuncs (sin, cos, sqrt, exp, log)
// - Reduction operations (sum, mean, etc.)
// - Lazy evaluation graph
// - Operator fusion

// These will be implemented in Phase 5 of the Rust backend development.
